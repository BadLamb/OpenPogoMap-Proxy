# OpenPogoMap-Proxy

This is the proxy server that routes the OpenPokeMap requests to third party servers

## How to run it
Set your go path and run the following commands
> go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
> go get github.com/Sirupsen/logrus
> go run *.go
And a local instance of the server should be running on your computer.
